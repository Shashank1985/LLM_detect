It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.\\n\\nOne solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said \\\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\\\" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.\\n\\nAs you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.\",\n          \"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \\\"vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\\\" There is a movement going on called, \\\"smart planning\\\" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realizing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.\\n\\nHow much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of nearrecord pollution, and decided to enforce a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twentyseven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. \\\"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog.\\\" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.\\n\\nSome cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 million people, and had a large turnout. \\\"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\\\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, \\\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\\\" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.\\n\\nResearchers have been studying America's ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or \\\"Mustang Sally.\\\" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. \\\"As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.\\\" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. \\\"With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..\\\" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.\\n\\nSince the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 1639 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don't really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or carpool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether or not this changes as these young people grow older, these decreases in driving are proving that cars might just not be as important as they used to be.\\n\\nOur planet is just continuing to get worse from emissions from cars. Some countries are starting to realize this and are working hard to limit car usage and have citizens rely just on public transportation, walking, or riding a bike. Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, \\\"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.\\\" Citizens all over the world can work together to reduce car usage and better improve our planet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn\\'t that far from you and doesn\\'t need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.'"

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\n2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\\n\\n3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state\\u2019s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .\\n\\n4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word \\u201cstate\\u201d also refers to the District of Columbia.\\n\\n5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate\\u2019s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .\\n\\n6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state\\u2019s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\u2019s electors.\\n\\n7 Most states have a \\u201cwinner-take-all\\u201d system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \\u201cproportional representation.\\u201d . . .\\n\\n8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a \\u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\\u201d listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state\\u2019s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.\\n\\n# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\\n\\n9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They\\u2019re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore\\u2014thanks to the quirks of the electoral college\\u2014won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What\\u2019s wrong with the electoral college\\n\\n10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you\\u2019d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party\\u2019s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\\n\\n11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, \\u201cfaithless\\u201d electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\u2019s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent\\u2019s electors, but he made sure to do so \\u201cwithout establishing a precedent.\\u201d What if it happened again?\\n\\n12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House\\u2019s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\\n\\n13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\u201cswing\\u201d states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\u2019t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\u2019t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .\\n\\n14 It\\u2019s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It\\u2019s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\\n\\n# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner\\n\\n15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you\\u2019re actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\n16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\u2019s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.\\n\\n17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.\\n\\n## 1) Certainty of Outcome\\n\\n18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible\\u2014--it happened in 2000--\\u2014but it\\u2019s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate\\u2019s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012\\u2019s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes\\u2014--538\\u2014--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .\\n\\n## 2) Everyone\\u2019s President\\n\\n19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised\\u2014to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn\\u2019t their president.\\n\\n## 3) Swing States\\n\\n20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates\\u2014as we saw in 2012\\u2019s election\\u2014to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign\\u2014to really listen to the competing candidates\\u2014knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\n## 4) Big States\\n\\n21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .\\n\\n## 5) Avoid Run-Off Elections\\n\\n22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .\\n\\n23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state\\u2014Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter\\u2019s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012\\u2019s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .\\n\",\n          \"# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal\\n\\n1 VAUBAN, Germany\\u2014Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.\\n\\n2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban\\u2019s streets are completely \\u201ccar-free\\u201d\\u2014except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park\\u2014large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\\n\\n3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban\\u2019s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. \\u201cWhen I had a car I was always tense. I\\u2019m much happier this way,\\u201d said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\\n\\n4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \\u201csmart planning.\\u201d\\n\\n5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\\n\\n6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\\n\\n7 \\u201cAll of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\\u201d said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: \\u201cHow much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.\\u201d\\n\\n8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\\n\\n9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \\u201ccar reduced\\u201d communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. \\n\\nExcerpt from \\u201cIn German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\u201d by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \\u201cMustang Sally\\u201d . . . .\\n\\n32 But America\\u2019s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren\\u2019t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.\\n\\n33 \\u201cWhat most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,\\u201d said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan\\u2019s Transportation Research Institute. \\u201cI think that means something more fundamental is going on.\\u201d\\n\\n34 If the pattern persists\\u2014and many sociologists believe it will\\u2014it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\u2019s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \\u201cmobility\\u201d companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.\\n\\n35 \\u201cDifferent things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,\\u201d said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.\\n\\n36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .\\n\\n37 New York\\u2019s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.\\n\\n38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak\\u2019s research has found.\\n\\n39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver\\u2019s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it\\u2019s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.\\n\\n40 Mr. Sivak\\u2019s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. \\u201cWhen I was in my 20s and 30s,\\u201d Mr. Sivak said, \\u201cI was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don\\u2019t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn\\u2019t work.\\u201d\\n\\n41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .\\n\\n42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.\\n\\n43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \\u201cpedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\\u201d\\n\\nExcerpt from \\u201cThe End of Car Culture\\u201d by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk. People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because bad wrecks, putting others' lives in danger, and may cause death.\\n\\nFirst of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.\\n\\nAnother reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.\\n\\nThe main key to not texting and driving while behind the wheel of a car. Mainly, it can cause tragic, terrifying, and horrific things to you and to others and that's death. That's the most important thing to not using electronic devices while operating a vehicle. With the intension, of you not keeping your eyes and staying focus on the road you can easily turn off the road or hit another victim. Possibly another humankind could go away of all flesh because of your stupidity.\\n\\nMust be remembered, always stay focus on the road so you can get to your destination safely. So, you can't cause accidents, put other people lives in danger, and possibly death. Important to realize, do not use your phone while operating a vehicle. At least, wait till you make a safe stop or until you arrive at your destination.                                                                      \",\n          \"Cell Phone Operation While Driving\\n\\nThe ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.\\n\\nWithin a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.\\n\\nConversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.\\n\\nThe creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.      \",\n          \"Driving while the use of cellular devices\\n\\nToday, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Phones and driving\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"persuade_corpus\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"RDizzl3_seven\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"According to the article \\\"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\\\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.\\n\\nIn the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,\\\"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'\\\" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.\\n\\nSchool behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, \\\"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \\\"smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,\\\" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.\\n\\nFinally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. \\\"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\\\" (D'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.\\n\\nThe use of the FACS to read the emotional \",\n          \"Many student's do not have opportunity to be part of one school. The school, or the study, are the most important thing for the future, because everyone depend of money, everybody need study to get a good job and make money. Each one know what want be in the future, so that is exactly whatever some need to study. Each person have those own personal problem's, therefore, not everybody have the opportunity to study in a school. In my opinion, class online is one benefit for every student and who want study.\\n\\nIs a benefit having online class, since not everybody have the opportunity deform part of school. At this day's should be take in consideration the online class. Exist a lot of method to learn and can be which someone want to be. One of the cases for everyone should not going to the school are for the sickness. At this day's everyone be expose to any illness, that's one reason why online class is a good option. At this time study in the own house is a benefit; also working in the own house should be good thing. Is one option work in home when is bad climate\\u00a0or include someone who can not going to work. In one part should be great going to work place because there are another people and is great know about the team work.\\n\\nI consider important the study, since, is all the necessary for comply the desire purpose. That why exist a lot of manner for having the complete study online, or in the school. Also, exist the disadvantage of which online class have a high cost. That cause the low chance of opportunity to person's who not have the necessary budget to pay. I think we live right now the perfect example for study online, cause of all things happen in a different school's and also the illness that everybody are confront around the world. In the old year's people do not having help for study and make future plan. The new youth have a big opportunity for make future plan at this time.\\n\\nMost people know that in this time the technology are the most important thing, therefore, it is possible do not be physical present in a classroom but can listening and see live class, basically the video conferencing. Having class in the own house should a good option because, give us more time to do the homework and study. Some student's who can be present in the school, need complete class, so student's use online class to comply that. Furthermore, is a good help to student's.\\n\\nFinally, for my viewpoint will be a good benefit for many student's can study online. Taking consideration the problem's, and the different opportunity from each one, should be excellent option online class.

If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times.

You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff.

I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"According to the article \\\"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\\\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.\\n\\nIn the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,\\\"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'\\\" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.\\n\\nSchool behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, \\\"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \\\"smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,\\\" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.\\n\\nFinally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. \\\"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\\\" (D'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.\\n\\nThe use of the FACS to read the emotional \",\n          \"Many student's do not have opportunity to be part of one school. The school, or the study, are the most important thing for the future, because everyone depend of money, everybody need study to get a good job and make money. Each one know what want be in the future, so that is exactly whatever some need to study. Each person have those own personal problem's, therefore, not everybody have the opportunity to study in a school. In my opinion, class online is one benefit for every student and who want study.\\n\\nIs a benefit having online class, since not everybody have the opportunity deform part of school. At this day's should be take in consideration the online class. Exist a lot of method to learn and can be which someone want to be. One of the cases for everyone should not going to the school are for the sickness. At this day's everyone be expose to any illness, that's one reason why online class is a good option. At this time study in the own house is a benefit; also working in the own house should be good thing. Is one option work in home when is bad climate\\u00a0or include someone who can not going to work. In one part should be great going to work place because there are another people and is great know about the team work.\\n\\nI consider important the study, since, is all the necessary for comply the desire purpose. That why exist a lot of manner for having the complete study online, or in the school. Also, exist the disadvantage of which online class have a high cost. That cause the low chance of opportunity to person's who not have the necessary budget to pay. I think we live right now the perfect example for study online, cause of all things happen in a different school's and also the illness that everybody are confront around the world. In the old year's people do not having help for study and make future plan. The new youth have a big opportunity for make future plan at this time.\\n\\nMost people know that in this time the technology are the most important thing, therefore, it is possible do not be physical present in a classroom but can listening and see live class, basically the video conferencing. Having class in the own house should a good option because, give us more time to do the homework and study. Some student's who can be present in the school, need complete class, so student's use online class to comply that. Furthermore, is a good help to student's.\\n\\nFinally, for my viewpoint will be a good benefit for many student's can study online. Taking consideration the problem's, and the different opportunity from each one, should be excellent option online class. People create another opportunity, showing that nothing is impossible for comply what people want. However is a benefit for all, having online class. It is necessary for what all can confront, and decide study online or physical in a school.\\u00a0 \\u00a0   \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
